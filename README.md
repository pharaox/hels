# Historical Erotic Loading Screens: Paintings

This is a collection of ? Crusader Kings 3 loading screens featuring paintings of European masters from the 15th to the 19th centuries that contain nudity or mildly erotic content. All original images are in the public domain and have been downloaded from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

The collection includes Orientalist paintings of [odalisques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odalisque), harems, [hammams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammam), and slave markets, as well as paintings on mythological subjects such as [rape of the Sabine women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_the_Sabine_women), [rape of Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia), [Lot and his daughters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot%27s_daughters), [Susanna and the Elders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_and_the_Elders_in_art), and others.

The focus when creating the mod has been on high quality originals, preferably ones that can be cropped to a 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio without losing too much of the original image. Each original has been cropped and resized to 1920x1080 (16:9), 1440x1080 (4:3), or 1080x1080 (1:1) depending on its aspect ratio, while preserving its quality as much as possible.

This mod is intended to be the first in a series of historical erotic loading screens mods. Future mods in this series may be based on prints, drawings, and miniatures from various periods and cultures.
